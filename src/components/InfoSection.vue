                Our tradition teaches that following death the soul ascends and is judged according to its deeds while
                alive in the physical realm. Everything accomplished by the soul, both positive and negative, is
                carefully considered. One of the greatest legacies one can leave behind is a family that has been
                inspired to serve Gâ€‘d, even during times of distress.

                When in the midst of this judgment the hallowed words of Kaddish ascend, uttered by those who grieve
                most intensely, this serves as a great merit for the soul. It is for this same reason that many
                undertake to do mitzvot in honor and memory of those who have passed away. They are seeking to prove
                that the departed is truly a worthy soul deserving of a lichtig Gan Eden, a "luminous Paradise."
